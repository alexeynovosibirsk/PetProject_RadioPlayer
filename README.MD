This is a simple player for i-radio stations.

The player after starting downloads playlists from github and buttons in the webUI will be named as downloaded playlists.

In order to use your own playlists add your repo address in RadioApplication.java (string 18)

The UI fits for sellphone (based on jsp):

Also keyboard shotcuts available:

alt + 1 - mute\unmute

alt + 2 - next station

alt + 3 - previous station

alt + 4 till 9 - switch playlists

All below is just for myself for using as embedded:
